# Claude Code Features

| # | Feature | Priority level | What it does | When to use it | Example | When it loads | What loads | Context cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [CLAUDE.md](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory) | Additive (all levels contribute) | Persistent context loaded every conversation | Project conventions, "always do X" rules | "Use pnpm, not npm. Run tests before committing." | Session start | Full content | Every request |
| 2 | [Skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) | managed > user > project | Instructions, knowledge, and workflows Claude can use | Reusable content, reference docs, repeatable tasks | /review runs your code review checklist; API docs skill with endpoint patterns | Session start + when used | Descriptions at start, full content when used | Low (descriptions every request)* |
| 3 | [Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/subagents) | managed > CLI flag > project > user > plugin | Isolated execution context that returns summarized results | Context isolation, parallel tasks, specialized workers | Research task that reads many files but returns only key findings | When spawned | Fresh context with specified skills | Isolated from main session |
| 4 | [Agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) | N/A | Coordinate multiple independent Claude Code sessions | Parallel research, new feature development, debugging with competing hypotheses | Spawn reviewers to check security, performance, and tests simultaneously | When launched | Independent context per session | Separate context per teammate |
| 5 | [MCP](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) | local > project > user | Connect to external services | External data or actions | Query your database, post to Slack, control a browser | Session start | All tool definitions and schemas | Every request |
| 6 | [Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide) | Merge (all hooks fire) | Deterministic script that runs on events | Predictable automation, no LLM involved | Run ESLint after every file edit | On trigger | Nothing (runs externally) | Zero, unless hook returns additional context |
| 7 | [Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) | Namespaced (avoids conflicts) | Bundles skills, hooks, subagents, and MCP servers into a single installable unit | Reuse setup across repositories or distribute to others via marketplace | /my-plugin:review uses namespaced skill from plugin | Session start | All bundled components (skills, hooks, subagents, MCP servers) | Depends on bundled components |
